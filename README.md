# Postman

The Postman repository contains collections of API tests.

### API Scripts

API Scripts shows the collection run flow using pre-requests at 3 levels 'collection-folder-request'. It also demonstrates how to use scripts to set or change parameters.

### Collection scripts

This collection runs one test script at the folder level. And there is a test script for the whole collection, that verifies the status code.
